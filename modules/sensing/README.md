# Sensing Modules

All classes and functions related to sensor control and data acquisition. This includes responding to MAVLink callbacks for Pixhawk/aircraft related sensor updates, as well as controlling external sensors such as the camera.

Sensors are categorised as either external or internal:
* Internal - Sensors related to UAV flight information, typically acquired/generated by the Pixhawk
* External - Sensors controlled by the Raspberry Pi, particularly those related to autonomous mission control
